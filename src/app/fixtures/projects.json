            "projectDescription": "The All-American Boys Chorus, America’s quintessential professional boys chorus, has delighted audiences worldwide for over forty years. Based in Costa Mesa, California. the Chorus is comprised of over 100 boys ages 8 – 15 drawn from throughout Southern California. Under the leadership of Artistic Director Wesley Martin, a veteran of Hungary’s renowned Kodaly Institute, the Chorus provides boys with comprehensive musical training and unsurpassed performance and touring opportunities. The choir was looking for a fresh face to their brand and wanted to show that off through their website. They had never had a strong online presence and looked to me to complete that goal for them. During the research phase I noticed that many of the choirs throughout the U.S.A. do not have a solid online presence and many of the sites look quite outdated and quite frankly put a bad taste in your mouth. I wanted to create something that looked just as good as the boys sound and could appeal to a kid wanting to have fun and make friends and parents that want a wonderful youth program for their young boy to grow and mature in.",

The board shows all buildings on the development along with its status of units available, pending and sold. This interactive presentation also features, modal galleries, floor plans and client-side filtering. This project was originally designed to be shown on a 1920x1280 resolution TV, however there was still a need for the project to be usable on an iPad or tablet if the sales office wanted to give walking tours with the interactive plan in hand.",
